don't touch anything with .sty extension. They're style documents.

write into chapter'%d'.tex documents

do file searches for 'placeholder', the comments will tell you what to fill in
do file searches for 'outcommented', remove '%' as soon as you've written the corresponding texts

possible errors:

compilation gives output of the form:
I couldn't open style file chicago.bst
---line 2 of file test.aux
 : \bibstyle{chicago
 :                      }
make sure you have the corresponding files installed. On Linux for example
install texlive-bibtex-extra
